# External Modules for Floppa Client Template

This Repository serves as a template for creating external modules for Floppa Client.
It features a minimalistic template for a module both in Java and in Kotlin.
Click on `Use this template` or fork this repository to begin.

If you are not sure which one of the two to use, I strongly recommend that you use Kotlin.

You should delete whichever you are not using.

You can create as many external modules as you want in one project. You can also create additional classes to use as 
libraries.

Mixins and adding resources are not supported.


## Building your Module.

To build your Module run the gradle task named `build`.
